      "entrezSummary":"This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family, which are characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. F-box proteins constitute one subunit of modular E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, called SCF complexes, which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box domain mediates protein-protein interactions and binds directly to S-phase kinase-associated protein 1. In addition to an F-box domain, the encoded protein contains at least 9 tandem leucine-rich repeats. The ubiquitin ligase complex containing the encoded protein may function in cell-cycle control by regulating levels of lysine-specific demethylase 4A. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]"
